Creating Tetris in JS


Project Choice:
  Tetris! (Single Player)

Project Description:
  My project is creating the classic game of Tetris, where a player will control a falling block consisting of 4 smaller blocks arranged in set patterns to fill a gridded well. Completing a horizontal line in the well will clear the line from the stack, and the goal is to not have a spawning piece at the top of the well spawn on top of a placed piece (Known as topping out). The goal is to play for as long as possible in the most basic form of Tetris.
